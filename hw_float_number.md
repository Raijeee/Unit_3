# What is the reason for the following result:
 
## 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 is False in Python

## Explain the reason:

When typing in 0.1+0.2 in the python console, python will give out 0.30000000000000004 as an output and therefore will not equal to 0.3. This ultimately comes down to how the computer understands code: binary. Binary contains two variables, 0 and 1 and therefore the commputer can only count in bases of 2. A computer to represent a decimal utilizes fractions, and since computers can only count in bases of two, the fractions denominator can only be in bases of 2, creating a large number of decimal fractions that cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. This is exactly why 0.1+0.2 cannot be acurately calculated in bases of two.
